## Random Quote Generator
*Project 1 of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript course*

###Project objectives:
* Given basic HTML and CSS files, write JavaScript to create a random quote generator which will display a new quotation on the screen after a button on the page is clicked, as well as after a set interval elapses.
* Randomly change the background color of the page when the quote changes.
* Don't display a random quote more than once until all quotes from the array have been displayed.

The project incorporates knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax including variables, loops and object literals.
